Before we start...

## Code of Conduct

* We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

---

## Code of Conduct

https://docs.carpentries.org/policies/coc/

---

## Code of Conduct

* Go to Instructors or Helpers if you feel the Code of Conduct is being violated.

* There is also a big blue "Report a Code of Conduct Incident" on the course website if you feel the Instructors are not handling appropriately.

## Introductions

### *Instructors and Helpers*

---

## What is the Carpentries?

https://carpentries.org/

The Carpentries is a global volunteer-driven organization dedicated to teaching computational skills to researchers and anyone who works with data.

---

## Carpentries at the Smithsonian

https://datascience.si.edu/carpentries

The Smithsonian Carpentries Team is made up of Smithsonian staff and fellows from around the institution.

---

## Carpentries way of teaching

Code along, rather than lecturing from PowerPoint, or just demonstrating

Odds of running into an error are high, but don’t panic – this is a great opportunity to learn

---

## ***We won’t leave you behind***

---

### How to make sure we don't leave you behind

In the real world, we used to use Post-It notes to indicate progress, but for this workshop we'll also use the "yes" / "no" buttons in the Zoom Reactions panel.

---

## How to ask questions

The Instructors will try to build in time between lessons to ask questions, but use the Zoom chat for questions that come up during a lesson.

## Course website

https://smithsonianworkshops.github.io/2025-01-smithsonian-online

---

## Course EtherPad

A collaborative document – think of it as a stripped-down version of Google Docs

https://pad.carpentries.org/2025-01-smithsonian-online

---

## Your first challenge

* Go to the EtherPad

* Add your name, unit, and answer the icebreaker question under Attendance for today

---

## What we will be teaching in this workshop

Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning.

---

> We will be teaching you a lot of valuable skills on a demo dataset, but you won't be able to add these tools to your *toolbag* until you work through how to apply them to your own data.
