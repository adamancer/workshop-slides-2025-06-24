## Carpentries way of teaching

Code along, rather than lecturing from PowerPoint, or just demonstrating

Odds of running into an error are high, but don’t panic – this is a great opportunity to learn

---

## ***We won’t leave you behind***

---

### How to make sure we don't leave you behind

In the real world, we used to use Post-It notes to indicate progress, but for this workshop we'll also use the "yes" / "no" buttons in the Zoom Reactions panel.

## How to ask questions

The Instructors will try to build in time between lessons to ask questions, but use the Zoom chat for questions that come up during a lesson.

## Your first challenge

## What we will be teaching in this workshop

Library Carpentry introduces you to the fundamentals of computing and provides you with a platform for further self-directed learning.

---

> We will be teaching you a lot of valuable skills on a demo dataset, but you won't be able to add these tools to your *toolbag* until you work through how to apply them to your own data.
